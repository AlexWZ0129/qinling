Welcome to Qinling's documentation!
===================================

.. note::

   Qinling (is pronounced "tʃinliŋ") refers to Qinling Mountains in southern
   Shaanxi Province in China. The mountains provide a natural boundary between
   North and South China and support a huge variety of plant and wildlife, some
   of which is found nowhere else on Earth.

Qinling is Function as a Service for OpenStack. This project aims to provide a
platform to support serverless functions (like AWS Lambda). Qinling supports
different container orchestration platforms (Kubernetes/Swarm, etc.) and
different function package storage backends (local/Swift/S3) by nature using
plugin mechanism.
